### reading the weather with jquery and ajax

Weathr is a simple app to, well, check the weather. It uses jQuery, Ajax and the OpenWeatherMap API to pull in weather date from a location inputted by the user.

This was a fun little project to practise working with APIs, and I'm really happy with how it turned out. '
